# Semaphore - iOS

Semaphore is a system that monitors physical mailboxes for deliveries and notifies users when mail arrives. In addition, Semaphore also categorizes and counts the number of items that are currently inside the mailbox and displays the information to the user in an associated smartphone application.  

This repository contains the iOS Smartphone Component.

Semaphore was created for the Electrical and Computer Engineering Capstone Design Symposium 2017 at the University of Waterloo.
